Ethiopian Medical Businesses Data Pipeline
This project involves building a data pipeline to scrape, clean, transform, and analyze data from Ethiopian medical businesses sourced from Telegram channels and the web. The pipeline includes data scraping, cleaning, object detection using YOLO, and data warehouse implementation.

Project Overview
Objectives
Data Scraping and Collection:

Scrape data from Telegram channels and the web.

Collect text data and images for object detection.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Clean and standardize the scraped data.

Use DBT (Data Build Tool) for data transformation and testing.

Object Detection:

Use YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection on collected images.

Data Warehouse Implementation:

Design and implement a data warehouse for storing and analyzing the data.

Data Integration and Enrichment:

Integrate data from multiple sources and enrich it for deeper insights.
